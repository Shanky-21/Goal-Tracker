# Goal-Tracker
This app will be related to tracking you day to day goals, and it will show you analytical informations


I'd be happy to help you create a roadmap for developing a goal-tracking Android application with the features you've described. Here's a step-by-step plan:

## Step 1: Learn Android Development Basics
Since you have full-stack experience but no mobile development background, start with:
- Learn Java or Kotlin (Kotlin is Google's preferred language for Android)
- Familiarize yourself with Android Studio and the Android SDK
- Study Android UI components and layouts

## Step 2: Plan Your Application Architecture
- Choose between a native Android app or a cross-platform solution like React Native or Flutter
- Design your database schema for storing:
  - Tasks/goals
  - Time tracking data
  - Point allocations
  - Recurrence patterns (daily/weekly/monthly/quarterly)
- Plan your app's architecture (MVC, MVVM, or MVP pattern)

## Step 3: Design Your UI/UX
- Create wireframes for key screens:
  - Dashboard/overview
  - Task creation/editing
  - Timer interface
  - Progress reports/statistics
  - Settings

## Step 4: Set Up Your Development Environment
- Install Android Studio
- Set up an emulator or connect a physical device for testing
- Create a new Android project with your chosen settings

## Step 5: Implement Core Features
1. **Goal/Task Management**
   - Create, read, update, delete (CRUD) operations for goals
   - Task categorization and priority setting
   - Point allocation system

2. **Time Tracking**
   - Start/stop timer functionality
   - Background service for tracking time even when app is minimized
   - Historical time data storage

3. **Recurrence System**
   - Logic for repeating tasks based on schedules
   - Task reset mechanisms for recurring items
   - Notification system for upcoming/due tasks

4. **Points and Analytics**
   - Calculate and display points earned
   - Create visual representations of progress
   - Generate insights based on performance

## Step 6: Data Persistence
- Implement local storage using Room Database or SQLite
- Add data backup/restore functionality
- Consider cloud synchronization (optional)

## Step 7: Testing
- Unit testing for core functionality
- UI testing for user interactions
- Performance testing, especially for background timer services

## Step 8: Refinement and Polish
- Optimize UI for different screen sizes
- Add animations and transitions
- Implement dark/light themes
- Ensure accessibility compliance

## Step 9: Deployment
- Generate a signed APK
- Create a Google Play Developer account
- Prepare store listing materials
- Submit to Google Play Store

## Recommended Learning Resources:
- Android Developer official documentation
- Udacity or Coursera Android development courses
- YouTube tutorials for specific features

Would you like me to elaborate on any specific part of this roadmap or provide code examples for implementing any of the core features?
